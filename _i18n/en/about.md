I love to write.

Over those years, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of awesome people, on several environments, working on different roles.

Althought I may approach some technical stuff, I'm aware that there are too many great content available out there. So, instead of trying to teach people out, I'm going to give my impressions about not-so-obvious aspects of the tech industry.
