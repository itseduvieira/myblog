#### About

## Hi there, I'm Eduardo Vieira.

Welcome to my little corner on the Internet.

I love to write.

Although I'm far as possible from being a writer, I built this site to share my perspective of the world, throughout the following series.

And learn something, maybe?

### On a synapse's perspective

*Our brain is indeed a incredible machine. An absolute unity.*

### The least action

*Sometimes reality looks much more miraculous than fiction.*

In the last decades physics have shown us how awesome the universe is, from the smallest structures to astonishing, incredible large objects of the cosmos.

### Abort, Retry, Fail?

*A reference to one of the most annoying error messages of all time.*

I've been working in the technology field for a while. Over the years, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of awesome people, on several environments, on different roles and projects.

Althought I may approach some technical stuff, I'm aware that there are already great content available out there. So, instead of trying to teach people out, I'm going to give my impressions about not-so-obvious aspects of the tech industry.

### Meta

*Writing is really hard.*

Communicate ideas to people over words is challenging, kind of liberating tough.
