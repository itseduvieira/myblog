Hello there!

How is it going?

I have been writing a lot in the last couple of years, but hardly published anything. I believe this is mostly due to a form of procrastination disguised as 'perfectionism'. This cliché is well-known when we try to express ourselves through writing process, also called ‘writer’s block’.

Well… I do not believe on that.

Although I’m aware that I’m not a writer, somehow I feel the urge to express my point of view about the world. Some of these topics, I have experienced throughout my life. Others, I’m just passionate enough to study about. Apart from some personal stuff, on this blog, I am going to write about technology, neuroscience and physics.

## The series

The way I choose to achieve this is splitting these topics in series, each one consisting of topics of each field by itself, which can be read independently. Although the same subject can be presented by different areas of knowledge, connected by two or more series.

Now is time to dive into the real stuff.

## Retry, Abort, Fail?

> _My point of view on technology, how it became virtually omnipresent and how deeply it affects us_

This error message was very popular among personal computers back in the '80s, especially when windows based systems weren't around.

## On a synapse's perspective

> _How about we understand the most amazing machine ever created: the human brain?_

A brain studying itself. How odd is that?

## The least action

> _This is where I give my impressions about the way physics try to explain reality_

Einstein's once said that an 'equation of everything' would represent a concept so elegant and simple, that any person should be able to understand it.

He already tried it himself on his very own $$ {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}} $$.

Following this idea of elegance and simplicity, in the '40s, the 'least action principle' was used to demonstrate a way of encapsulate mostly motion theories into this simple concept.

Since then, the simplest form of this principle $$ {\displaystyle \delta {\mathcal {S}}=0} $$ became one of the most fundamental equations in all physics.
