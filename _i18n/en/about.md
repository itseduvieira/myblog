# About

Hello there!

I have been writing a lot in the last couple of years, but hardly published anything. I believe this is mostly due to a form of procrastination disguised as 'perfectionism'. This cliché is well-known in the writing process, especially when we try to express ourselves. People call it ‘writer’s block’.

I do not believe in that.

The real reason is simply because I couldn't find discipline. And this is about to change now.

## The series

Although I am aware that I am not a writer, somehow I feel the urge to express my point of view about the world. On some of these topics, I have experienced them throughout my life. On others, I’m just passionate enough to study about them. Apart from some personal stuff, I intend to write here about technology, neuroscience, psychology and physics.

The way I chose to achieve this goal was splitting these topics in series, each one consisting of one specific field, which can be read independently. Sometimes though, the same subject can be approached on different areas of knowledge, connected by two or more series.

By now it's time to dive into the real thing.

## Retry, Abort, Fail?

> _My point of view on how technology became virtually omnipresent and affects us so deeply_

This error message was very popular among personal computers back in the '80s, especially when windows based systems weren't around.

## On a synapse's perspective

> _How about we understand the most amazing machine ever created: the human brain?_

A brain studying itself. How odd is that?

## The least action

> _This is where I give my impressions about the way physics try to explain the reality_

Einstein's once said that an 'equation of everything' would represent a concept so elegant and simple, that any person should be able to understand it.

He already tried it himself on his very own $$ {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}} $$.

Following this idea of elegance and simplicity, in the '40s, the 'least action principle' was used to demonstrate a way of encapsulate mostly motion theories into this simple concept.

Since then, the simplest form of this principle $$ {\displaystyle \delta {\mathcal {S}}=0} $$ became one of the most fundamental equations in all physics.
